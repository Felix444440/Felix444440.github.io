        <h1>Alexander Aucoin</h1>
        <h2>I'm a freshman student at Louisiana State University majoring in
            Mechanical Engineering with a hope to focus in Automotive
            Engineering in the future.
            I'm also a part of the Ogden Honors College and currently work in
            the Chevron Center managing 3D and poster printing, computers
            stations, and a techology checkout system.
            Entering a field of work related to environemntal protection and
            restoration is one of my hopes after graduating in 2029.
