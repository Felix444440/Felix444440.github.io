        <p>I was responsible for the Introduction of the report as well as
            working with a team
            member to write out the Human Interface sections of the system
            report. I wrote and modelled the
            componets for the Blade Release Lever, Speed Control Wheel, and the
            Lock on Switch.
            Additionally, I designed, modelled, and wrote the report for the
            improvement to the lock on Switch
            for the human interface system. </p>
